// Coding Challenge #1 
// Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is 
// calculated using the formula: 
// BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg 
// and height in meter). 

// Your tasks: 
// 1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables 
// 2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both 
// versions) 
// 3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about 
// whether Mark has a higher BMI than John. 
// Test data: 
// ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 
// m tall. 
// ยง Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 
// m tall.

var massM = 78, massJ =92;
var heightM = 1.69, heightJ=1.76;

function BMI(m,h){
    return m/(h ** 2);
}

console.log(BMI(78,1.69));
console.log(BMI(92,1.76));
console.log(BMI(95,1.88));
console.log(BMI(85,1.76));
